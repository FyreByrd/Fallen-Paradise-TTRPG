The arcanist is similar to a wizard in D&D or Pathfinder. Arcanists have no natural mana regeneration, but are able to utilize a significantly higher number of receptacles compared to other casters. This does mean that wizard could cast a larger number of much higher level spells, but also risks their magic being confiscated.
