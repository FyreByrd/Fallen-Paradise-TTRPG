The monk is similar to a monk in D&D or a kineticist in Pathfinder. Rather than being mostly martial arts focused, a FP monk is more similar to a 5E Four Elements monk, but, hypothetically at least, is actually good. A monk must strike a careful balance between mastery of the elements and martial prowess.
