This is a repository of information/rules for a TTRPG in a fantasy setting I have been working on for a while. The setting is intended to later be developed into an open world RPG video game. Many of the notes are still on paper, so it will be a bit before everything is fully translated into the digital form that is this website.

## Inspiration

The system itself is inspired by different table-top systems that I have played, most notably: D&D 5E, Pathfinder 2E, and Fabula Ultima. The setting is inspired by the wide variety of SciFi and Fantasy novels that I have read. There are too many to list here, but some of the most notable inspirations are Lord of the Rings, Chronicles of Narnia, The Spiderwick Chronicles, The Chronicles of Prydain, and Redwall (why do most of these have the word *chronicle* in them?).
