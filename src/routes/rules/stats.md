All characters have six stats:
- **S**trength: A character's ability to deal physical damage and perform other feats of atheleticism.
- **F**ortitude: A character's ability to take damage and recover from physical effects.
- **D**exterity: A character's ability to dodge and perform other acts requiring finer motor skills.
- **A**cuity: A character's capacity to observe their surroundings and utilize experience.
- **I**ntellect: A character's capacity to learn and remember.
- **W**ill: A character's capacity to direct magical forces and resist their more subtle effects.

The average value for a non-adventuring human in any given stat is `1d8`.
The smallest a stat can be, through any means, is `1d4` and the largest is `2d20`, although stats will range between `1d6` and `2d12` solely through normal level ups (The extended range is achievable by a raging [Berserker](/classes/berserker) or a [Monk](/classes/monk) who is more focused on physical power).
## Using Stats

Most checks involving character stats will usually use the results of rolling two different stats or the same stat twice. Bonuses or penalties that would be applied to the roll may not count more than once. For example a character whose **strength** stat is `1d10 + 1` will roll `2d10 + 1` for a **2_S_** check rather than `2d10 + 2`.

### Calculating Passive Values

In some circumstances an ability or check may not use a roll but may instead refer to the *passive* value of a stat. The *passive* value of a stat is calculated as the statistical expected value (`&LeftFloor;(min value + max value) / 2&RightFloor;`) of a single roll in the stat. Any applicable bonuses or penalties will increase or decrease the *passive* value accordingly. A table is provided below for convenience.

| *Size* | *Passive* | *Size*      | *Passive* |
| ------ | --------- | ----------- | --------- |
| `1d4`  | 2         | `1d4 + 1d6` | 6         |
| `1d6`  | 3         | `2d6`       | 7         |
| `1d8`  | 4         | `2d8`       | 9         |
| `1d10` | 5         | `2d10`      | 11        |
| `1d12` | 6         | `2d12`      | 13        |
| `2d4`  | 5         | `2d20`      | 21        |

### Calculating Modifiers

In some circumstances an ability or check may not use a roll but may instead refer to the *modifier* (abbreviated as *mod*) of a stat. The *modifier* is calculated as the `&LeftCeiling;passive / 2&RightCeiling; - 2`. A table is provided below for convenience.

| *Size* | *Passive* | *Size*      | *Passive* |
| ------ | --------- | ----------- | --------- |
| `1d4`  | -1        | `1d4 + 1d6` | +1        |
| `1d6`  | 0         | `2d6`       | +2        |
| `1d8`  | 0         | `2d8`       | +3        |
| `1d10` | +1        | `2d10`      | +4        |
| `1d12` | +1        | `2d12`      | +5        |
| `2d4`  | +1        | `2d20`      | +9        |

## Character Creation and Leveling

By default, a level 1 character will have **1d8** in each stat and can choose to *decrease* the size of up to two stats to *increase* the size of up to two stats.
